P.S. The database was hosted on http://www.freesqldatabase.com/, and due to the fact that I've forgot to extend my account, the database is now lost, until I pay some money for subscription :( 
However the you can peek at the source code and check User Guide to get a basic understanding of functionality. On demand, I can recreate the database, however I do not have motivation right now, because I am working on a different project.
